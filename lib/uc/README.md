# uc

The top level `usecode` command. `uc` itself holds no subcommand logic: like
`git`, it looks up `uc-<name>` and hands the process over to it, so a new
subcommand is added by dropping a `uc-<name>` executable next to `uc` or
anywhere on `PATH`.

```sh
uc help                # list the uc-* commands found on PATH
uc encrypt secrets.txt # runs uc-encrypt
```

This crate ships the dispatcher, the two file encryption subcommands, which
replace the former `boom` shell script, and `uc configure`, the machine
configurator.

## Encrypting files

```sh
uc encrypt secrets.txt        # -> secrets.txt.asc, secrets.txt removed
uc decrypt secrets.txt.asc    # -> secrets.txt, the .asc kept
uc decrypt -c secrets.txt.asc # print the plaintext instead of writing it
```

Both commands prompt for the password on the terminal and never echo it.

* `-f` overwrites an existing output file; without it an existing file is an
  error.
* `uc encrypt` decrypts its own output and compares it against the input before
  it removes the original, so a failed encryption never costs the plaintext.
* `uc decrypt` accepts only `.asc` files and leaves the encrypted copy in place.
* Output files are written through a temporary sibling and renamed, with mode
  `0600`, so an interrupted run cannot leave a half-written file behind.

### File format

The `.asc` file is exactly what `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -salt -a`
produces — an 8-byte salt behind a `Salted__` magic, AES-256-CBC with PKCS#7
padding, base64 wrapped at 64 columns — so `openssl` remains a usable fallback:

```sh
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -a -in secrets.txt.asc
```

`uc decrypt` also opens files written with the pre-OpenSSL-3.0 MD5 key
derivation, and says so when it does; re-encrypting upgrades them.

## Configuring the machine

`uc configure` configures the local machine — Apt sources and packages,
extrepo repositories, dotfiles, git checkouts, toolchains, desktop settings —
without Python or Ansible. Independent tasks run in parallel:

```sh
uc configure                    # everything, for the detected profile
uc configure -C                 # dry run: report what would change
uc configure -t dotfiles,git    # only these roles
uc configure -t zls -d          # zls plus everything it runs after
uc configure -l -t 'git/*'      # list tasks, their tags and dependencies
uc configure --graph | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg
```

It keeps the architecture of the Ansible playbook it replaced:

* **modules** (`src/configure/modules`) are the reusable steps, after Ansible's
  modules: `copy`, `template`, `file`, `inflate`, `command`/`shell`, `apt`,
  `git`, `make`, `systemd`, `group`, `uri`. Each is idempotent, reports
  `ok` or `changed`, and honours `--check`.
* **roles** (`src/configure/roles`) are the configuration functions, one
  per Ansible role, adding tasks built from those modules to the plan.
* the files and templates live in `roles/<role>/{files,templates}` and are
  read from the checkout. Templates render with Ansible's Jinja settings and
  see the same variables, including `ansible_facts`.

### Scheduling

Every task has an id, `<role>/<step>`, and names the tasks it runs
**after**. A task starts as soon as each of those has finished, or was left
out by the tags or its condition, with at most `-j/--jobs` tasks running at
once (default: the number of CPUs, or `UC_CONFIGURE_JOBS`). Clones,
downloads and repository setup therefore overlap, while tasks touching dpkg
queue on a shared lock.

A failed task blocks only the tasks after it; the others carry on and the
recap counts them as `blocked`. `-x/--fail-fast` stops starting new tasks
after the first failure instead. A handler becomes a task that runs after
the tasks that notify it and acts only when one of them changed something
(`sysctl/apply`, `udev_hwdb/rebuild`).

### Tags

Tags follow Ansible: `-t` runs tasks carrying any of the tags, `-s` leaves
them out, `always` tasks run unless skipped by name, and `never` tasks
(`apt/upgrade`, `git/fetch:*`) run only when asked for by an explicit tag or
their id. A task's role and id also work as tags, and tags may contain `*`.
`-d/--with-deps` also pulls in what the selected tasks run after.

### Options

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-t, --tags` / `-s, --skip-tags` | select tasks, comma separated |
| `-d, --with-deps` | also run the selected tasks' dependencies |
| `-j, --jobs N` | tasks running at the same time |
| `-p, --profile` | `workstation`, `vm`, `wsl` or `dev_container`; also `INSTALL_PROFILE`, else `dev_container` with `DEV_CONTAINER` set, `wsl` on a Microsoft kernel, or `workstation` |
| `-e KEY=VALUE` | set a template variable, like Ansible's `-e` |
| `-C, --check` | dry run |
| `-x, --fail-fast` | stop after the first failure |
| `-l, --list`, `--list-tags`, `--graph` | inspect the plan and exit |
| `-v, --verbose` | stream every command's output |
| `--roles DIR`, `--config FILE` | the role files (`lib/uc/roles`) and the user config, found automatically |

Tasks that need root run through `sudo -n`; when the selection has any,
`uc configure` asks for the password once, before the run, and keeps the
credentials fresh until it ends.

## Build

```sh
make build    # cargo build --profile release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
make check    # fmt --check, clippy -D warnings, tests
make install  # install uc, uc-encrypt, uc-decrypt and uc-configure to /usr/local/bin
```

`make install` honours `DESTDIR` (with a trailing slash) and `PREFIX`, e.g.
`make install PREFIX=$HOME/.local`.

The default target is `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, added with `rustup` on first
use. The crate has no C dependencies, so the result is a static-pie executable
with no shared libraries at all — it runs on any Linux of the same
architecture, including a `scratch` container, and needs no `openssl` on the
host. `TARGET=` picks another triple, e.g. a dynamically linked glibc build:

```sh
make build TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```
